                <h3> About </h3>
                <p>Alexey Arkhipovich Leonov (30 May 1934 – 11 October 2019) was a Soviet and Russian cosmonaut, Air Force major general, writer, and artist. On 18 March 1965, he became the first person to conduct a spacewalk, exiting the capsule during the Voskhod 2 mission for 12 minutes and 9 seconds.</p>

                <p>On March 18, 1965, Leonov left Earth on his first flight into space with the Voskhod 2 mission. Leonov served as pilot for the 26-hour flight, commanded by Pavel Beyayev. Ninety minutes after launch, Leonov left the relative safety of his spacecraft, and became the first person to float freely in the vast, silent expanse of space.</p>

                <p>It is initially successful and the country celebrates, but Alexey's suit over-inflates, rendering him clumsy and unable to enter the airlock. It was one of most difficult moments of his life – getting back into the capsule.</p>
